# Properties of Lattice Structure üìê

This repository contains scripts for analyzing and predicting the properties of lattice structures. All scripts are designed for cubic cells with a default edge length of **a = 10 mm**. The size of a single cell and material properties can be customized as needed.

## Homogenization for Lattice Structures

To obtain homogenized properties for a single lattice cell, use the following MatLab scripts:

### 1. **Elastic Properties**
Run the MatLab script `homogenization.m` in **COMSOL 6.2 or higher**.  
**Input:**  
- Material properties: Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, density (default: TC4 material).  
- Geometry file in `.stp` or `.step` format.  

**Output:**  
- Elasticity tensor.  
- Compliance tensor.  
- Density.  
- Volume.  

### 2. **Plastic Properties**
Run the MatLab script `stress-strain curve for a single cell.m` in **COMSOL 6.2 or higher**.  
**Input:**  
- Material properties: Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, density, plasticity curve (default: TC4 material).  
- Geometry file in `.stp` or `.step` format.  

**Output:**  
- Stress values.  
- Strain values.  
- Z-component reaction forces.  

Both scripts can be used as functions for streamlined calculations.

## Prediction of Stress-Strain Curves from Geometry

### Step 1: Geometry Parsing
Use the Python notebook `parcer.ipynb` to parse geometry files in `.stl` format.  
**Input:**  
- `.stl` file.  

**Output:**  
- Node coordinates.  
- Adjacency matrix.  
- Connection vectors.  

### Step 2: Deep Learning Prediction
Use the Python notebook `DNN.ipynb` to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for stress-strain curve prediction.  
**Process:**  
1. Dimensionality reduction.  
2. CNN-based prediction.
